SuperSkeleton Update Notes and Changelog.



====================


1.04

Major updates in this one! Nearly every core file, along with style.css, buttons.css, flexslider.css, flexslider.js was changed.

All changes are listed below. The most notable change is that there is now an option to have thumbnail images link to a lightbox, or to their full post. This one setting (found in the Theme Options under Basic Settings) controls this for the entire site... from the homepage blurb images to blog post thumbnails. If you set it to Yes, all thumbnails will open up their full featured image, blurb image (only if it's on the homepage), or their "lightbox link" (which can be a video url like http://vimeo.com/230201).

[X] The Flexslider plugin was upgraded from 1.4 to 1.7!
[X] Updated Documentation - including a new small section on how to build menus and a new 
"how to update the theme properly" PDF.
[X] Add additional social options.
[X] Color changer option for default tag colors. 
[X] Make lightbox launch optional for the thumbnails (Portfolio, Blog, and Homepage included here).
[X] Make the slide links optional on the homepage slider.
[X] Make homepage blurb images are now optional.
[X] Make the lightbox links on the homepage optional
[X] Full width is now an option for individual blog posts (Posts Meta Box).
[X] When the TopBar is removed, there was a margin that stuck around at the top of the page. Now that's gone.


====================


1.03

element-navigation.php - Patched the Twitter/Facebook flip
style.css, styles.css, header.php, Stopped using @import for the stylesheets. All are loaded directly using the link method in header.php now for performance improvements.
skeleton-key.js, footer.php - Make the dropdown chosen an option 
element-navigation.php, functions.php - Create a second menu for the dropdown


====================
